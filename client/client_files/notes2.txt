As the air fills with the rhythmic beats of the dhak and the scent of shiuli flowers, I wanted to send my warmest wishes to you and your family on the auspicious occasion of Durga Puja.
This festival is a beautiful celebration of Maa Durga's victory over the demon Mahishasura, a powerful reminder that good always triumphs over evil and that divine strength and courage reside within us all. It is a time for joy, devotion, and, most importantly, coming together with loved ones.
May the divine blessings of Maa Durga:
Empower you with strength and courage to overcome life's challenges.
Fill your life with peace, prosperity, happiness, and success.
Deepen the bonds of love and unity within your family and community.
I hope your days are filled with the vibrant energy of the pandals, delicious festive feasts, and cherished moments with friends and family.
Wishing you a memorable and blessed Durga Puja!
With love and best wishes,
